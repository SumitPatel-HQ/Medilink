## 🚀 **How to Test the Application:**

### **1. Start Both Servers:**

npm run dev

# Frontend (Port 3000)
cd web
npm run dev
```

### **2. Access the Application:**

- Backend API: http://localhost:5000

### **3. Test User Flows:**

#### **Patient Flow:**
1. Visit http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Sign Up" → Register as Patient
3. Login → Go to Dashboard
4. Test email verification (if email is configured)
5. Book appointment → Select doctor and time
6. View appointments → Check status
7. Upload medical report → Select appointment and file
8. Update profile → Add personal information

#### **Doctor Flow:**
1. Register as Doctor with specialization
2. Login → Go to Dashboard
3. View patient appointments
4. Confirm/cancel appointments
5. Update profile with clinic info

## 🔍 **API Testing Examples:**

You can test the APIs directly using tools like Postman or curl:

```bash
# Test server connection
curl http://localhost:5000/greeting

# Register a new user
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/v1/auth/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"John Doe","email":"john@example.com","password":"password123","role":"patient"}'

# Login
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"john@example.com","password":"password123","role":"patient"}'
```

## 🎯 **What's Working:**
