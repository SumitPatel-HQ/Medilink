1. Async app / server setup; currently mongodb intializes after server launch.
    - expected, server should start after all the services has been initialized.
2. Email sender integration for otp (for trial purpose)
3. Write all frontend logic for these APIs.


Backend tasks:
1. send email through mail sender for any appointment bookings and cancellations done.
2. Handle async behaviour of the mongodb connection and server start.
3. Create a route to get file from appwrite to view on the frontend.
